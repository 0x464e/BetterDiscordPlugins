##  [CrashRecovery](https://github.com/1Lighty/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/master/Plugins/CrashRecovery "CrashRecovery")
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PLUGIN! In the event that your Discord crashes, the plugin enables you to get Discord back to a working state, without needing to reload at all.

##  [MentionAliasesRedux](https://github.com/1Lighty/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/master/Plugins/MentionAliasesRedux "MentionAliasesRedux")
This is a complete rewrite of MentionAliases by Metalloriff, so credits to him for the idea.

Set custom @mention aliases, that can also appear next to their name (nearly) anywhere, as well as have mention groups to mention multiple people at once.
## [SaveToRedux](https://github.com/1Lighty/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/master/Plugins/SaveToRedux "SaveToRedux")
This is also a complete rewrite of Save To by Metalloriff.

Allows you to save images, videos, profile icons, server icons, reactions, emotes and custom status emotes to any folder quickly.
## [UnreadBadgesRedux](https://github.com/1Lighty/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/master/Plugins/UnreadBadgesRedux "UnreadBadgesRedux")
Shows an unread badge on folders, server icons and channels, all toggleable with the count adjustable.
