# BetterUnavailableGuilds [![download](https://i.imgur.com/OAHgjZu.png)](https://1lighty.github.io/BetterDiscordStuff/?plugin=BetterUnavailableGuilds&dl=1 "BetterUnavailableGuilds")
Makes unavailable guilds (servers) still show in the list, and be able to drag it around/interact with it.
### Features
Whenever BetterDiscord, BetterDiscord2 and some other servers go unavailable, they are removed from your sidebar, even your folder, and shown as ! all the way at the bottom, which is annoying.
This plugin simply fixes that, so the server stays in the sidebar and you can move it around/interact with it, you just can't view anything inside it.
BetterDiscord and BetterDiscord2 servers are precached for convenience sake.
