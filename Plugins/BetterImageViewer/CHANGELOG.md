# [BetterImageViewer](https://1lighty.github.io/BetterDiscordStuff/?plugin=BetterImageViewer "BetterImageViewer") Changelog
### 1.1.0
- *SOME* people kept asking, so here you go.
- Added image zoom, simply activate by click and holding on the image.
- Use scroll wheel to zoom in and out, hold shift while scrolling to change lens size.
- If you prefer using a different plugin to handle zooming for you, that's fine too, there is a toggle to disable it in settings.
- The click and hold can of course be easily changed in the settings to your prefered method of zooming.
