# [MentionAliasesRedux](https://1lighty.github.io/BetterDiscordStuff/?plugin=MentionAliasesRedux "MentionAliasesRedux")
Set custom @mention aliases, that can also appear next to their name (nearly) anywhere, as well as have mention groups to mention multiple people at once.
### Features
Right click on a user or DM to set an alias, or create a group or add them to a group.
This alias will show next to their name, like a BOT tag, but only you see it.
You can tag them with this alias, just as if they had that very alias as their name.
