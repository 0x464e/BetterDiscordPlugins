# CrashRecovery [![download](https://i.imgur.com/OAHgjZu.png)](https://1lighty.github.io/BetterDiscordStuff/?plugin=CrashRecovery&dl=1 "CrashRecovery")
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PLUGIN! In the event that your Discord crashes, the plugin enables you to get Discord back to a working state, without needing to reload at all.
### Features
If your Discord crashes when you open it, it'll attempt to "uncrash" it, and disable any plugin that is preventing recovery.  
If it completels, it will tell you exactly what plugin may have caused the crash (if it can detect it).  
If you had toasts enabled and plugins got disabled due to the crash, it will reenable them for you.  
If your Discord crashes out of random (maybe you clicked something?) it'll attempt to recover with the same steps as above.  
In the event that recovery fails, you still have some info on what plugin may have been responsible for the initial crash, and have a button alongside the reload button, to try to recover again, maybe after removing a plugin from your plugins folder.
